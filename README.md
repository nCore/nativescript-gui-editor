# nativescript-gui-editor
NativeScript cross-platform GUI editor

TODO:
* Implement: 
    * canvas on which we can drag 'n' drop elements like Button, Label, TextField, Image etc.,
    * palette for all supported components
    * property editor 
    * layout containers 
    * style editor
    * example apps
* Think about:
    * external API for communication from outside the application to easily use inside the editors/IDEs as an extension/plugin
    * a way of exporting/implementing designed views into actual NativeScript application
    * offline-first /or/ completely offline application approach
    * ... other not mentioned things
